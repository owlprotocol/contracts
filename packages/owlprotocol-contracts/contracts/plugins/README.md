# Crafter and Minter contracts

Crafter contracts implement input(s) -> output(s) crafting mechanism for ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens. Supports both transfer of existing tokens as well as the minting of new ones (in this case, configured for OWL tokens).

Minter contracts implement a variety of methods to generate unique token IDs and mint ERC 721 assets to the caller. Currently configured to support breeding, randomized, and simple generation of OWL NFTs.
